# Day 14? of 50 days in hack club
## What is 15 days in hack club
15 Days is a program that was started by a community member, where for the last 50 days of the year people share what they do every day after setting goals in the slack, this is so that people can keep track of their goals and make sure that they are staying on task every day and getting things done. I happend to be one of the people that decided to participate in this program and as a part of this program I want to stay commited, so while the Hack Club slack is down for 2 days, I will post my updates here and maybe even the rest of them, who knows!

## What even are my goals?
Here were my original goals:
    - Get better at the portuguese language (learning for fun)
    - Work on my scripting language called [**ivoryscript**](https://github.com/SamhithPola2025/IvoryScript)
    - Work on my CPU simulator called [**bitreactor**](https://github.com/SamhithPola2025/BitReactor)
    - Work on my physics engine (it is going to be pretty basic) called [**bouncylabs**](https://github.com/SamhithPola2025/bouncylabs)
    - Practice guitar <u>consistently</u> every day
    - Work on old advent of code and USACO problems just to get better at problem solving
    
## Finally, what did I do today?

Today was a busy and fulfilling day, and I made progress on multiple fronts. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:

- **BouncyLabs**: I spent a significant amount of time improving the physics engine. One of the key features I added was the ability for users to create squares, which adds more variety to the shapes available in the simulation. I also implemented functionality where the radius and size of objects directly affect their weight, making the physics more realistic and dynamic. Additionally, I fixed several bugs that were causing unexpected behavior and ensured that more controls are now working seamlessly. These changes have made the engine more robust and user-friendly, and I’m excited to continue refining it.

- **Advent of Code**: I worked on a variety of challenging coding problems as part of Advent of Code. These problems pushed me to think critically and revisit some fundamental concepts in programming. It was a great opportunity to sharpen my problem-solving skills and explore creative solutions to complex tasks. Each problem felt like a small victory, and I’m looking forward to tackling more in the coming days.

- **Guitar Practice**: I dedicated time to practicing guitar, focusing specifically on classical pieces. Classical music has always fascinated me, and today I worked on refining my technique and improving my finger placement. It was rewarding to see progress as I played through intricate compositions, and it reminded me of the joy that comes from mastering a challenging piece.

- **Portuguese Language**: As part of my goal to learn Portuguese, I watched several videos on colloquial Portuguese. These videos were incredibly helpful in understanding the informal and conversational aspects of the language, which are often not covered in traditional learning resources. It was fascinating to see how native speakers use idiomatic expressions and casual phrases in everyday conversations.

Overall, today was a day of learning, creativity, and problem-solving. Whether it was coding, music, or language, I felt like I made meaningful progress in each area. I’m excited to carry this momentum forward and see what tomorrow brings!
